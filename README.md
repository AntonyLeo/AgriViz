# AgriViz

"AgriViz: Integrated Agricultural Yield Monitoring and Visualization System," portrays a solution for modern agricultural data management and analysis. The main idea behind this project involves the creation of a SQL relational database on Amazon RDS, together with a structured data processing pipeline. Raw agricultural yield data is systematically collected, organized, and made available for further analysis.

The front end is a user-friendly web application which is created by Python Flask and MySQL, that helps in accessibility for various users. The application includes a secure login and registration system. The home page consists of field, dates, and year selection options for various fields. The center of this project lies in the integration of Amazon QuickSight, a data visualization tool. Users can quickly transition to QuickSight, where they gain access to raw yield data that they selected on the home page. This empowers them to explore, analyze, and visualize the data in various ways, from heat maps to geographical plots, and can also apply filters for customized insights on the raw data.
